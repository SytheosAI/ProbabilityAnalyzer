# Migration to Supabase Complete! 🎉

Your Sports Probability Analyzer has been successfully migrated from PostgreSQL to Supabase. Here's what was done and what you need to do next.

## What Was Completed

### ✅ 1. Supabase Client Installation
- Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency
- Package is now ready to work with Supabase

### ✅ 2. Environment Configuration
- Updated `.env.local` with Supabase configuration variables
- Commented out old PostgreSQL variables for reference
- Added the Supabase URL you provided: `https://qnhuezgavmjdvayhydpe.supabase.co`

### ✅ 3. Supabase Client Setup
- Created `/src/lib/supabase.ts` with client configuration
- Includes both client-side and server-side (admin) clients
- Added comprehensive TypeScript types for all database tables

### ✅ 4. Database Service Migration
- Completely rewrote `/src/services/database.ts` to use Supabase instead of pg
- Maintained all existing method signatures for backward compatibility
- All your existing API routes will continue to work without changes
- Added new helpful methods like `healthCheck()` and improved error handling

### ✅ 5. SQL Schema Generation
- Created `supabase_schema.sql` with all necessary database tables
- Includes proper indexes, foreign keys, and relationships
- Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies for production readiness
- Includes useful views for common queries

### ✅ 6. Testing & Validation
- Application builds successfully with no errors
- All API routes are compatible with the new database service
- TypeScript types are properly configured

## What You Need to Do Next

### 🔑 1. Update Your API Keys
Edit your `.env.local` file and replace the placeholder values:

```env
# Replace these with your actual Supabase keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key_here
```

You can find these keys in your Supabase project:
1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → API
4. Copy the `anon/public` key and `service_role` key

### 🗃️ 2. Create Database Tables
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Open the `supabase_schema.sql` file from your project root
4. Copy and paste the entire contents into the SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" to create all tables, indexes, and policies

### 🚀 3. Test Your Application
After updating the API keys and running the schema:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now:
- Connect successfully to Supabase
- Display no "Invalid API key" errors
- Allow you to save/retrieve games, predictions, and other data

### 🔒 4. Security Considerations (Optional but Recommended)

The current setup uses permissive RLS policies for easy testing. For production, consider:

1. **Implement proper authentication**
2. **Restrict RLS policies** based on user roles
3. **Review and tighten security policies**

## Key Benefits of This Migration

✨ **No Database Password Needed** - Use Supabase API keys instead
🔒 **Built-in Security** - Row Level Security and API key management
📊 **Real-time Capabilities** - Supabase provides real-time subscriptions
🌐 **Hosted Solution** - No need to manage PostgreSQL server
📈 **Scalable** - Supabase handles scaling automatically
🔧 **Better DX** - TypeScript support and modern tooling

## Files Modified

### New Files:
- `/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client configuration
- `/supabase_schema.sql` - Database schema for Supabase
- `/MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `/package.json` - Added Supabase dependency
- `/.env.local` - Updated with Supabase configuration
- `/src/services/database.ts` - Complete rewrite to use Supabase

### Unchanged Files:
- All API routes (`/src/app/api/**/*.ts`) - Work automatically with new service
- All React components - No changes needed
- All other application logic - Fully backward compatible

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" errors
- Make sure you've updated both API keys in `.env.local`
- Restart your development server after updating environment variables

### "Table doesn't exist" errors
- Run the SQL schema in your Supabase SQL Editor
- Check that all tables were created successfully

### Connection issues
- Verify your Supabase URL is correct
- Check that your Supabase project is active and running

## Next Steps

1. Update your API keys (required)
2. Run the database schema (required)
3. Test the application
4. Start using your app with real Supabase data! 🎉
