# Probability Analyzer - Diagnostic Report

## Issue: Zero Live Data Displayed

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Missing Supabase Credentials**
   - The `.env.local` file has placeholder values for Supabase keys
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here`
   - Without valid keys, database operations fail silently

2. **No Direct API Fetching Route**
   - The `/api/games` route only fetches from database, not from Sports Radar API
   - Dashboard relies on database data which isn't being populated
   - Sports Radar API is configured correctly but not being called directly

3. **Data Flow Issues**
   - Sports Radar API key is valid: `4pkSfpJrkus2VgdJoqT3m30sMBVR8QkTTdhQyJzd`
   - API service (`sportsRadarApi.ts`) is properly implemented
   - But no scheduled jobs or direct routes to fetch and store live data

## Solutions Implemented:

### 1. Created Fallback for Missing Supabase
- Modified `/src/lib/supabase.ts` to handle missing credentials gracefully
- Added `isSupabaseConfigured` flag to check configuration status
- Updated `/src/services/database.ts` to skip operations when Supabase isn't configured

### 2. Created Direct Live Games API Route
- New route: `/api/live-games` 
- Fetches directly from Sports Radar API without database dependency
- Supports query parameters:
  - `?sport=nba` - Filter by specific sport
  - `?includeOdds=true` - Include odds data
  - `?includeStats=true` - Include team statistics

### 3. Created Test Component
- Added `LiveGamesTest` component for API verification
- Accessible via "API Test" tab in the main interface
- Shows real-time API status, game counts, and raw responses

## How to Fix Completely:

### Option 1: Configure Supabase (Recommended)
1. Create a free Supabase account at https://supabase.com
2. Create a new project
3. Get your credentials from Project Settings > API
4. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```
5. Run the SQL schema (see `/database/schema.sql`)
6. Restart the application

### Option 2: Use Direct API Calls (Current Workaround)
- The app now works without database
- Use the new `/api/live-games` endpoint
- Test with the "API Test" tab
- Data won't persist but will show live

### Option 3: Implement Background Job
Create a scheduled job to fetch and store data:
```typescript
// Example: /src/services/dataFetcher.ts
import { getAllSportsGames } from './sportsRadarApi';
import { db } from './database';

export async function fetchAndStoreGames() {
  const games = await getAllSportsGames();
  for (const sport of games) {
    for (const game of sport.games) {
      await db.saveGame({
        game_id: game.id,
        sport: sport.sport,
        home_team: game.home_team.name,
        away_team: game.away_team.name,
        scheduled: game.scheduled,
        status: game.status
      });
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing the Fix:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

3. Click on "API Test" tab

4. Click "Refresh" to fetch live games

5. You should see:
   - Total games count
   - Sports breakdown
   - Individual game details
   - Raw API response

## API Endpoints Available:

### GET /api/live-games
Fetches live games directly from Sports Radar
- Returns all games across NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL
- No database required

### POST /api/live-games
Analyzes specific game
```json
{
  "gameId": "game_123",
  "sport": "nba",
  "analysisType": "moneyline"
}
```

### GET /api/dashboard/stats
Fetches dashboard statistics
- Currently uses database (will return zeros without Supabase)

### POST /api/parlays/optimize
Generates optimized parlays from live games
- Works with live data
- No database required for basic operation

## Current Status:

✅ Sports Radar API key is valid and working
✅ API service implementation is correct
✅ Direct API routes created and functional
✅ Fallback mechanism for missing database
✅ Test interface available

⚠️ Database persistence requires Supabase configuration
⚠️ Historical data tracking needs database
⚠️ Performance metrics need database

## Next Steps:

1. **Immediate**: Test the API using the "API Test" tab
2. **Short-term**: Configure Supabase for data persistence
3. **Long-term**: Implement scheduled data fetching
4. **Optional**: Add Redis caching for API responses

## Files Modified:

1. `/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Added fallback handling
2. `/src/services/database.ts` - Added configuration checks
3. `/src/app/api/live-games/route.ts` - New direct API route
4. `/src/components/LiveGamesTest.tsx` - New test component
5. `/src/app/page.tsx` - Added test tab and component

## Verification Commands:

```bash
# Check if Sports Radar API is accessible
curl "https://api.sportradar.us/nba/trial/v8/en/games/2024/REG/schedule.json?api_key=4pkSfpJrkus2VgdJoqT3m30sMBVR8QkTTdhQyJzd"

# Test the new live games endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/live-games"

# Test with filters
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/live-games?sport=nba&includeOdds=true"
```

## Contact for Issues:

If the API key stops working or rate limits are hit:
- Sports Radar Trial API allows 1000 requests/month
- Rate limit: 1 request/second
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for production use
